# Configs

These are the configs used to generate the docset.

## Issues
> These configs partially working, listed here the known issues.

- [`dndkit.docsetconfig`](./dndkit.docsetconfig) - Main page and links are not working, when going to pages by the search bar, it shows the page fine, but when clicking on the link or in the home page, it doesn't work. - Probably due to the Next.js usage, probably hydratation errors or so.
